# What is it?
Script that brute forces missing letters of a string with an alphanumeric dictionary

# What am I using it for?
There was an internet puzzle, or ARG (Alternate Reality Game) back in 2018 called canium, it had a terminal like interface where you could ask it questions and it would spit out answers in an anagram. One of the clues was t-a-19-/ and a theory was the dashes were missing characters. So, I used this script to brute force t-a-19-/. I made it output all the possible combinations to a text file with "python > output.txt"

# To-Do's
- [ ] Add an "input()" function so you could input your own string with missing characters (dashes) to brute force.
- [ ] Make a way for it to save the output to a text file after the script ends without telling it to from the command line.
- [ ] more stuff probably...
